# fall.bot

This bot is designed to run on the same machine as a dedicated DST server running on a virtual machine. It uses discord as a medium for interacting with the server through commands and bash scripts to make using the server more user-friendly and time efficient.

You can adapt this bot to work on any virtual machine and interact with any server. Let me know if you have any questions or need help using it for your own project.
